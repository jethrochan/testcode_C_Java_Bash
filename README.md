testcode_C_Java_Bash
====================
Greetings Fellow Programmer,

I recently added this additional section to my github portfolio. This is stuff I explored to hone my CS skills. One of my programming partners needed basic formats for what a bash script looks like, so I uploaded a simple one for those of you who need help on writing in Bash. I have a bunch of more complicated Bash scripts for those of you interested.
Feel free to run and look at the code here for learning purposes. 

Good Luck,

Jethro
